# Display Internet Speed Meter on Taskbar with NetSpeedMonitor
To view the internet speed on the taskbar of your Windows PC, you’ll need to download a software named NetSpeedMonitor. If you’re on Windows 10, your system will stop the installation with a message saying “Operating system not supported”. This is because the app was primarily designed to operate on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista and Windows 2007.

However, that doesn’t mean it won’t work on your Windows 10 PC. For that, you’ll need to run the app in compatibility mode, which we’ve explained in detailed steps below.

Step 1: First and foremost, you need to download the app from this link (https://www.softpedia.com/get/Network-Tools/Bandwidth-Tools/NetSpeedMonitor.shtml). You’ll get two download options: x86 and x64. The former is for a 32-bit Windows system and the latter is for a 64-bit Windows system. Download the correct version as per the system type of your PC. 

Tip: If you don’t know your Windows system type, you can easily check it by opening ‘This PC’ folder on your Windows PC and right-clicking anywhere. Then select ‘Properties’ and check under ‘System’ type.

Step 2: Go to the folder where you’ve downloaded the app file. If your system is running Windows 7 or lower, the installation process will start normally. Anything above it will show the operating system not supported. Don’t worry. You can easily install it on Windows 8 or above by tweaking certain things.

Step 3: Right-click on the setup file (for example, netspeedmonitor_2_5_4_0x64_setup.msi) and go to Properties.

Step 4: Now Click on the Compatibility tab, and check the box in front of ‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’. The dropdown will show ‘Previous version of Windows’. Click on OK to save the changes. 

Step 5: After this, double click the setup file to start the installation process and follow the on-screen instructions to complete it.

Step 6: Note that you won’t be able to see the internet speed directly after installing the NetSpeedMonitor app. You’ll need to enable the program first.

Step 7: To enable the program, right-click anywhere on your taskbar and hit the Toolbars option. Then select NetSpeedMonitor. After enabling, you will see the upload and download speed on your taskbar.
